Feel free to interact with the dashboard [HERE](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMDVkMWY2NzgtZTI5Zi00MTBjLThkMDUtYTY2ZmJhYWI4ZTgzIiwidCI6ImRjZjEzZWE4LWQ5YjUtNGQxNS05NDg4LTQ5ZWI1OTJmNGYzOSIsImMiOjh9)

### Analysing a hotel dataset gotten from onyx data which contains booking details of 2 hotels which includes the
* Lead time
* Arrival date
* Duration of stay
* Customer demographic (adults/children)
* Meal type
* Country of customers 
* Deposit type
* Agent
## Key Insights : 
### Who are our customers?
![who are yor customers](https://github.com/vickkycodes/HOTEL-ANALYSIS-/assets/103611857/949c1d7c-ecdb-41e0-bc87-9ed1d5f691b1)
### What meals are the customers having?
![what meals are the customers having](https://github.com/vickkycodes/SPACE-MISSION/assets/103611857/cf985beb-7cd8-4ea5-83dd-d3aa634bb835)
* There are four kinds of meals plans in the hotel which are the;
* FB(Full board breakfast, launch and dinner)
* BB(Bed and breakfast)
* HB(Breakfast and dinner)
* SC(Self-catering)

The full board is the least requested meal plan which makes sense since its the most expensive. About 9% prefer to fend for themselves(Self_cater), 12% of the customers would rather have just breakfast and dinner(HB) while a huge majority of 78% would rather have just breakfast(BB).

### Where are the customers coming from?
![hotel origin](https://github.com/vickkycodes/HOTEL-ANALYSIS-/assets/103611857/7c331501-7808-4e1e-b124-0a410a3030f0)

The vast majority of the customers are coming from portugal its very likely the hotels are in portugal.


### Customers likely to cancel based on cancel rate
![customer type](https://github.com/vickkycodes/HOTEL-ANALYSIS-/assets/103611857/d8a080d5-e19f-447e-adf0-7410249ff687)

Transcient customers who are looking to have a short stay or just stay a night have the highest cancel rate(40%) which could be because its mostly a last minute booking and they are not looking to stay for long so they could have a change of plans meanwhile the group reservations have a really low cancel rate(10%) which is expected because they would have planned it out and are likley to stay longer maybe for a holiday.

### When do customers arrive?
![arrive](https://github.com/vickkycodes/HOTEL-ANALYSIS-/assets/103611857/b2d5b5e1-ae4c-46ef-bf57-053263b2b3a9)

It would appear that customer reception are really low during the christmas/new year season and are really high between july and august which are summer season and people travel a lot during that time of the year.

### How do customers make their reservations?
![customer segment](https://github.com/vickkycodes/HOTEL-ANALYSIS-/assets/103611857/92f19e15-beb7-4d7a-997a-a7b0c4efcaa0)

In this time and age most people prefer to do all their bookings and plannnings online which makes sense that most customers come in through online travel agencies rather than offline travel agencies.
